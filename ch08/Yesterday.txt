Yesterday, all my troubles seemed so far away.
Now it Looks as though they,re here to stay.
Oh, I believe in Yesterday.
Suddenly, I,m not half the man I used to be.
There's a shadow hanging over me.
Oh, yesterday came suddenli.
Why she had to go?
I don't know , shw wouldn't say.
I said something wrong.
Now I long for yesterday.
